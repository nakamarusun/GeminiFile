GeminiFile is a peer-to-peer folder syncing application that works on your local network. Whereas cloud services would need internet and is only as fast as what your internet speed is. GeminiFile works on your Wi-Fi router, and even works on Mobile Hotspots. GeminiFile also only syncs folder IDs that 2 devices or more have the same of, meaning that your files can not be downloaded by other people who does not have your folder's ID.

#### Current platform in development:

- PC / Windows
- Mac
- Linux
- Android (TODO)
- iOS (TODO)

## TODO:

- Configuration file for advanced networking stuff.
- Rewrite better communication codes between peers.
- Only adds peer that is trusted.
- Better auto discovery.
- Can detect and delete files (Need database).
- SSL Connection.
- Opens only one TCP port.
- Better GUI, and use gradle to build the GUI project.
- Android and iOS port.
- More of course

GeminiFile is coded in java 11, for my second semester programming language final project.
